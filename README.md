# TipCalculator
CS6300 Assignment 4 application for dividing the cost of a meal including tip among a group of people. This manual describes the operation of the application. 

Enter the total cost in the "Check amount" field. The values must be greater than zero and only numbers are allowed. An error "Toast" will be shown if a bad value is provided. 

Enter the "Party size". If a fractional party size is entered, it will be changed (truncated) to an integer and shown in place of the fractional value. As with the "Check amount", a bad "Party size" value will result in an error Toast displayed that says "Empty or incorrect value(s)!". 

The keyboard will be hidden when the COMPUTE TIP button is pressed so no need to take time closing it. The keyboard will be restored when either of the entry fields is tapped.

Press the "COMPUTE TIP" button in the middle to calculate the Tips and totals (per person). The tip percentages will be shown as integers rounded to the nearest whole dollar. The only problem with rounding is that a value less than 50 cents becomes 0. The total is also shown as a value rounded to the nearest whole dollar.

Extra features include saving and restoring information in the App when you minimize and restore, checking the default keyboard to number input, and clearing the total and party lines when clicked.
